# IU Crimson Cupboard Project

## Introduction
The IU Cupboard Website is a graduation project developed by Indiana University students to support the IU Cupboard initiative. IU Cupboard provides essential food assistance to students facing food insecurity. Despite its pivotal role, there has been a lack of an online system to facilitate its operations. This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a comprehensive database system that allows students to book appointments and view real-time inventory of available food items, enhancing accessibility and operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Donation Schedule:** Allows people to donate food.
- **Real-Time Inventory Updates:** Displays current food items available, ensuring students have up-to-date information.
- **User Accounts:** Students can create and manage their profiles to track their appointments and requests.
- **Admin Panel:** Enables admins to manage inventory, appointments, and user inquiries effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP:** Server-side scripting for backend logic.
- **MySQL:** Database management for storing user and inventory data.
- **HTML/CSS:** Frontend presentation and styling.
- **JavaScript:** Enhanced user interactions on the frontend.
